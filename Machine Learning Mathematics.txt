	Density Estimation
		Methods
			Cubic Spline
			Kernel Density Estimation
				Uniform, Triangle, Quartic, Triweight, Gaussian, Cosine, others...
				non-parametric
				real-valued
				 non-negative
				it's a type of PDF that it is symmetric
				integral over functionis equal to 1
				calculates kernel distributions for every sample point, and then adds all the distributions
		Postly Non-parametric. Parametric makes assumpsions on my data/ranbome variables fro instance that hey are normally distributed. Non-parametric doesnot.
		The methods are generally intended for description rather than formal inference.
	Regularization
		Mean=constrained regularization
		Sparse regularizer on columns
		Early Stopping
		L1 norm
		L2 norm
		Dropout
		Nuclear norm regularization
		Clustered mean=constrained regularization
		Graph-based similarity
	Distributions
		Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
		Definition
		Type (Density Function)
